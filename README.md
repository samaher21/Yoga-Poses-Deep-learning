## Introduction:

Yoga Pose Image is a collection of the images for yoga exercises,The pictures mostly consists of one person doing a pose of yoga. In this project we aim to classify and predict the name of the pose. Our goal is to build deep learning model on this data.

## Problem statement:
In this project we have a collection of unordered pictures of yoga poses, and our goal is to classify and predict the name of the pose.

## Data Description:

Which contains 5 Classes Tree Pose
Warrior1 Pose
Downward Dog Pose and about 6000 pictures.
