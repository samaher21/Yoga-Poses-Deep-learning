## Introduction:

Yoga Pose Image is a collection of the images for yoga exercises,The pictures mostly consists of one person doing a pose of yoga. In this project we aim to classify and predict the name of the pose. Our goal is to build deep learning model on this data.

## Problem statement:
In this project we have a collection of unordered pictures of yoga poses, and our goal is to classify and predict the name of the pose.

## Data Description:

The datasets we selected are:

- from Keggel [**Yoga Pose Image classification dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutisaxena/yoga-pose-image-classification-dataset),the whole dataset.

- from the website [**New Dataset for Yoga Pose Classification**](https://laurencemoroney.com/2021/08/23/yogapose-dataset.html),200 pictures for each poses.

- from kaggel [**Yoga Pose Image classification dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutisaxena/yoga-pose-image-classification-dataset),around 100 pictures for eash poses.

Which contains 5 Classes: (Tree Pose,Warrior1 Pose,Downward Dog Pose, Mountain Pose, Goddess Pose) and about 3478 pictures.
