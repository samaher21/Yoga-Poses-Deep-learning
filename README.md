## Introduction:

Yoga Pose Image is a collection of the images for yoga exercises,The pictures mostly consists of one person doing a pose of yoga. In this project we aim to classify and predict the name of the pose. Our goal is to build deep learning model on this data.

## Problem statement:
In this project we have a collection of unordered pictures of yoga poses, and our goal is to classify and predict the name of the pose.

## Data Description:

The dataset we selected is from Keggel [**Yoga Pose Image classification dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutisaxena/yoga-pose-image-classification-dataset).
Which contains 107 columns and about 6000 pictures.
