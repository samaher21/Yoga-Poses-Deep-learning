# Yoga Poses

                  

## Goal of the project:
In this project we have a collection of unordered pictures of yoga poses, and our goal is to classify and predict the name of the pose.
## Workflow:
First, we resized all the images in the dataset to 132x132 size. We turned our pictures dataset into an array in preparation to feed it to the model. We divided the training data into train and validation with a ratio of 0.25.

**The figure above shows**, the left side of the figure, we can see **the validation loss vs. the accuracy loss**, we have the validation loss as **0.5829** and the accuracy loss which is **0.5304**.
In the right side of the figure, we see **the accuracy score vs. validation score**, which at **0.8242** and **0.8148** respectively.


## Next step:
We will feed the test portion of the dataset to our model and classify the names of the poses.
