# writeup
## introducation:
Yoga Pose Image is a collection of the images for yoga exercises,The pictures mostly consists of one person doing a pose of yoga. In this project we aim to classify and predict the name of the pose. Our goal is to build deep learning model on this data.
in this project we collected pictures of yoga for five moves:
- tree
- goddess
- mountain
- downdog
- worrier
we had to use three datasets to get a decent number of pictures for our final dataset. links for the datasets we used can be found in the README file.
## Result & notes:
in this porject we worked on five models:
- for the baseline we used logistic reggresstion and it gave us these scores
74% for training, 74% for valdation, and 77% for testing portion of the dataset.
- for the other four models we used manily CNN and one model for transfer learning, all results can be seen in the following table:

## Conclusion
In this model we were able to achieve our goal in getting a high accuracy.
There are hundreds more poses of yoga, but we choose those five for the goal of simplicity.
For future work we hope that we can produce an application that can correctly classify the movement of the yoga practitioner.
